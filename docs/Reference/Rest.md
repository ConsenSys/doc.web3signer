# REST API

Interact with the Eth2Signer APIs using the web browser by accessing
`http:<interface>:<port>/swagger-ui` where:

* `interface` is specified using [`--http-listen-host`](CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#http-listen-host)
* `port` is specified using [`http-listen-port`](CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#http-listen-port)

The default location is `http://localhost:9000/swagger-ui`.

[Eth2Signer REST API documentation] is also available.
